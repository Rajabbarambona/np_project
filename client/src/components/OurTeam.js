      The Tourism Company has two active consultants, Rajab Barambona and Salha
      Rajab . Both are experienced tourism professionals with a significant
      track record in tourism consultancy. Although each has a different
      background, level of experience and particular areas of interest, we are
      both involved in tourism planning, development, research and marketing
      work. Our skills are largely complementary and interchangeable.
